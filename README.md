# ETCS-Moving-Block-System


Repository migration notice

This repository is no longer actively maintained.  
Ongoing development and updates have been moved to the following GitLab repository:

👉 **https://gitlab.univ-eiffel.fr/julie.beugin/ETCS-Moving-Block-System**




This repository hosts **formal behavioural models** and **verification artefacts** supporting **research on the safety of ETCS Moving Block railway systems**.  
The work extends modelling previously initiated in **PERFORMINGRAIL (2020–2023)** and is aligned with the **Shift2Rail X2Rail-1, X2Rail-3, and X2Rail-5** functional specifications.

## Context

This research is conducted within the **"Safety of Railway Systems" Chair**, funded by **Certifer**.
